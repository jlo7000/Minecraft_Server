#====================================== PvP Messages ======================================#
### What to do with PvP Death Messages?
# 1 = Don't Show any of Them.
# 2 = Show them as Usual.
# 3 = ONLY show PvP Death Messages.
PvP_Death_Messages_Handling: 2

#====================================== World Settings ======================================#
### Disable ALL Death and Generic messages to those worlds, total silence, no message comming from the world itself or from any other.
Silenced_Worlds:
- TooManyDeaths_world
- NoSpam_world

### Linking worlds allows worlds to share death/generic messages, worlds out if this list will ONLY see it's own messages.
# Example: as you can see in this list, the worlds "world", "world_nether" and "world_the_end" are linked, so Death and Generic messages will be shared, if we have another world called "new_world", will only be able to see it's own Death and Generic Messages.
Linked_Worlds:
  Enable: false
  World_List:
  - world
  - world_nether
  - world_the_end

#====================================== Generic Messages ======================================#
### Enable/Disable all Generic Messages; if disabled, will totally turn off the listeners, so this part will not affect performance.
# (YOU HAVE TO RELOAD or STOP/START THE SERVER FOR THIS OPTION TO HAVE EFFECT)
Generic_Messages: true

### On Player FIRST Join Message:
Player_First_Join: '&6The Player &b%player &6has joined the Server for First Time!'

### On Player Join Message:
Player_Join: '&aThe Player &b%player &ahas joined the Server!'

### On Player Leave/Disconnect Message:
Player_Disconect: '&cThe Player &b%player &chas left the Server!'

### On Player Kick Message:
Player_Kick: '&cThe Player &b%player &chas been Kicked Thanks Obama!'

#====================================== Death Messages ======================================#
### Change those TAGS as you wish.
# %player = Player (victim) name
# %killer = Player Assasin name (only for player kills, PvP)
# %weapon_material = Material name of the weapon wielded by the killer(only for player kills, PvP)
# %weapon_name = Meta display name of the weapon, instead of the material one, if there's no name it'll show the material one.
# %world = World name in which the player died, can be used in any message.

### Don't forget to use bukkit colors if you want ===>    http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/42/45/Colors.png
# And other Bukkit Formats ===>    &n = Underlined   ||   &o = Italic   ||   &m = Strike-through   ||   &l = Bold   ||   &k = Magic   ||   &r = Reset Format

### Some Examples:
# Example for Creeper Message = '&2%player &Elikes to hug &CCreepers&E, he is a pill of dust now...'
# Example for PvP Message = '&2%player &Ewas slain by &Ckiller&E, wielding his mighty &C%weapon'

### TAKE CARE ABOUT SPECIAL CHARACTERS OR NON-ENGLISH ONES! THE BUKKIT YAML PARSER DON'T ALLOWS THEM! CHECK THE PLUGIN PAGE TO USE VARIABLES INSTEAD TO SHOW THEM!

### Finally, you can add/modify/remove all the random messages you wish, when a death occurs, a random message from the list will be chosen.
# REMEMBER, THERE'RE NOT ONLY 2 POSSIBLE RANDOM MESSAGES, ADD/REMOVE ALL YOU WISH! INFINITE POSSIBILITIES!
